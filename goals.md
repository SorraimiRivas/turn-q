# Queue Logic

[x] Must function like a Queue, first in first out, last in and last out.
[x] Queue must be random at first and then stay the same once it is set, unless an admin wants to redo.
[x] Queue must repeat once every object has gone thru the whole cycle.
[ ] If an object is not "ready", the next one should be first on Queue.
[ ] Once an object if back to "ready", it must have precedence on the Queue.

# UI

[x] Queue should be represented as a List
[ ] The List should be composed by cards with name, status, status indicator, and background status indicator.
[ ] There should be a button to change the status or indicate when the objects should be moved on the Queue
[ ] There should be an indicator for people online and how many should be online.
[ ] There should be a text that shows who is next on the line.
